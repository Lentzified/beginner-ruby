# How To Ruby!

#### By me, yo.

Ruby is a language used to make websites and is one of the building blocks of a language known as _Rails_. In order to truly understand Ruby, we first must understand the importance of _Variables_, _Conditionals_, and _Methods_.

*  ## Variables
    Variables are used to represent _values_ such as integers, strings, booleans, and floats.
    * ### Assigning Variables
        When assigning a variable, we first need to know which variable we wish to assign and name that variable.

         We are going to define the number **10** as "more_than_nine"

        ```
        more_than_nine = 10
        ```

        Easy enough, right?

    * ### Using Variables
        Now that we know
